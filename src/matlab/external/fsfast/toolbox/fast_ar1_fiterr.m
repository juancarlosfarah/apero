% error function for fitting an AR1 noise model while also taking
% into account the bias introduced by GLM fitting. This function
% can be used with fminsearch, which uses Nelder-Mead 
% unconstrained non-linear search. 'Unconstrained' may cause
% problems. 
%
% rho - AR1 parameter
% racf is actual residual ACF (nf-by-1). Should be created with
%       racf = fast_acorr(r,'unbiasedcoeff');
% R is residual forming matrix (nf-by-nf)
% w is the weight of each delay (nf-by-1). If unspecified,
%   no weighting is performed. In simulations, works best
%   without weighting. But those are simulations. Consider
%   weighting with w = 1./[1:nf]';
% 
% err = sum( abs(racf-racfexp).*w ); % L1 norm
% 
% Autocorrelation function of AR1+White Noise
%   acf(n) = rho^n, n=0:nf-1
%
% Example:
%  rho = racf(2); % Init
%  rhoopt = fminsearch('fast_ar1_fiterr',rho,[],racf,R);
%  nacfopt = rho.^[0:nf-1]';
%  [e racfexp] = fast_ar1_fiterr(rho,racfmn,R);
%  plot(1:nf,racf,1:nf,racfexp)

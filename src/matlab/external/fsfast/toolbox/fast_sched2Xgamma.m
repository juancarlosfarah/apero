% [X, a] = fast_sched2Xgamma(tPres,ntrs,TR,delay,dispersion,bcw,W)
%
% Creates a design matrix (aka stimulus convolution matrix) modeling
% the hemodynamic response as a single gamma function. The size of 
% the matrix X will be ntrs-by-1. a is the assumed form.
%
% tPres - list of presentation times (ie, the schedule) in seconds 
% for one event type. Time=0 is defined as the time the first stored 
% image was collected (ie, ignore discarded acquisitions). An event
% before t=0 will have an effect on the matrix if its Post Stimulus 
% Window encompasses t=0; otherwise it is ignored. Events found
% after the termination of data collection are ignored (a warning 
% is printed). If tPres is empty, a matrix of zeros is returned. 
%
% ntrs - number of functional volumes collected (do not include 
% discarded acquisitions or prescan time).
%
% TR - TR of the exmperiment (ie, time between acquisitions of 
% functional volumes) in seconds.
%
% delay - delay in the gamma function
% dispersion - time constant
% bcw - convolve with a boxcar of width bcw (seconds)
%
% W - presentation weighting. Length should be NPresentations. The
% matrix entry for each presentation is given the value W(n) instead
% of 1. Ignored if W=[].

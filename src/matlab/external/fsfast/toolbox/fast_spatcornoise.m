% Create spatially correlated, temporally white noise.
%
% Nf = number of frames
% Nv = number of voxels
% pvs = percent variance spanned. If not present or empty,
%   pvs = ones(Nv,1), ie white. pvs will be normalized to 
%   sum to 1. It can be computed from s with pvs = diag(s), 
%   so it can be obtained from a previous call.
% v = spatial eigenvectors. This can be obtained from a 
%   previous call in order to generate a new set of noise
%   with the same spatial correlation. The spatial correlation
%   will be v*s*s*v'
%
% y = (u*s)*v'; 
%
% y is rescaled globally so that the variance over all elements
% is 1.

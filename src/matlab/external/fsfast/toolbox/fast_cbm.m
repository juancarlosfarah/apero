% [cbm idealcbm cbmerr] = fast_cbm(seq,maxorder)
%
% Defines nth order counter balancing as the probability of 
% getting a particular stimulus n stimuli after another 
% stimulus. The counter-balancing matrix (CBM) is NxNxmaxorder
% (N = number of event types) where the entry in the ith row 
% and jth column of the kth matrix is the probability of seeing 
% event j k events after event i. 
%
% All the numbers within a column of the idealcbm are the same 
% and equal the number of times the jth type was presented divided 
% by the total number of presentations. The idealcbm is NxN and
% is the same for all orders.
%
% The cbmerr is the difference between the actual cbm and the 
% idealcbm. 
% 
% Notes: event type 0 is removed before processing.
%
% See also fast_cbm2(). Unlike fast_cbm2(), the CBM of all orders
% (upto and including maxorder) are computed.

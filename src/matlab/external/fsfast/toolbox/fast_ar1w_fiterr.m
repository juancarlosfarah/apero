% error function for fitting an AR1+W noise model while also taking
% into account the bias introduced by GLM fitting. This function
% can be used with fminsearch, which uses Nelder-Mead 
% unconstrained non-linear search. 'Unconstrained' can cause
% problems. 
%
% p = [alpha rho];
% racf is actual residual ACF (nf-by-1). Should be created with
%       racf = fast_acorr(r,'unbiasedcoeff');
% R is residual forming matrix (nf-by-nf)
% w is the weight of each delay (nf-by-1). If unspecified,
%   no weighting is performed. In simulations, works best
%   without weighting. But those are simulations. Consider
%   weighting with w = 1./[1:nf]';
% 
% err = sum( abs(racf-racfexp).*w ); % L1 norm
% 
% Autocorrelation function of AR1+White Noise
%   acf(0) = 1
%   acf(n) = (1-alpha)*rho^n
%
% Example:
%  p = [0 racf(2)]; % Init as simple AR1
%  popt = fminsearch('fast_ar1w_fiterr',p,[],racf,R);
%  nacfopt = fast_ar1w_acf(popt(1),popt(2),nf);
%  [e racfexp] = fast_ar1w_fiterr(popt,racfmn,R);
%  plot(1:nf,racf,1:nf,racfexp)
% 
% Notes: 
%  1. For nf=100 and nice racfs, takes about .35 sec on 
%     Athalon 1GHz and scales with nf^2.
%  2. As alpha->1, the error is less sensitive to rho.
%  3. There is a danger of local minima. This parameterization
%     is not well conditioned as very different combinations
%     of alpha and rho can lead to very similar ACFs. Try
%     initializing with fast_ar1w_fit on the RACF.
%  4. There is a major penalty for abs(rho) > 1 or 0 > alpha < 1,
%     otherwise the unconstrained optimization can lead to
%     inappropriate values. Don't know if this is the best
%     way to do this.

% PDF of bivariate binomial distribution. Each trial consists of
% two coin flips, so there are four possible outcomes: 00, 01, 10,
% 11. The probabilities of only the three are needed because
% they must sum to 1. c is a 3-tuple row vector of the number of
% times the first three outcomes were realized over ntrials. Again
% the number fourth outcomes is not needed because the number of
% outcomes must sum to ntrials. 
%
% c - row vector of number of outcomes. Only the first 3 columns
% are used. If more than one row, then a p is computed for each
% row. 
%
% p - probability of seeing the distribution of c outcomes.

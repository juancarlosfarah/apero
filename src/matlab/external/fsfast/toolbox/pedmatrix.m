% Computes the post-excitation delay of each sample in a k-space
% image, including multiple echos. The k-space image is
% nrows-by-ncols with even lines going in the same direction as odd
% lines (ie, if the even lines were reversed during acquisition,
% then they have been reversed again in the k-space image). If
% there are multiple echos, then it is assumed that the even echos
% were collected in reverse order (but have been reversed again in
% the kspace image).
%
% echo1ped - time to the first echo of the first line
% echospacing - time between lines/echoes
% delsamp - time to first sample after the start of the ramp
% tDwell - time between ADCs

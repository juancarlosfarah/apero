%
% Computes the contrast matrix for a single condition.
%
% TER  - temporal estimation resolution (s)
% TW   - total time window (s)
% TPS  - prestimulus window (s), including delay = 0
%
% SumDelays = 1, forces Delays to be weighted by WDelays and summed.
%   Forces the contrast matrix to be a vector.
%
% WDelays - delay weighting vector. Ignored if SumDelays = 0. If
%  [], replaced with ones (ie, forces a simple average).
%
% RmPrestim = 1 subtract prestimulus average; will replace
%   the prestim components of WDelays. If the delays are not
%   summed, then the final matrix will have nPreStim fewer
%   rows than than if RmPrestim was not used.
%
% If the prestim is not removed and SumDelays=0
% then returns the identity of size nDelays = round(TW/TER).
%
% If the prestim is not removed and SumDelays=1, then returns 
% a vector of length nDelays with all the components 1/Nh.

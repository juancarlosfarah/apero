function X = fast_sched2Xfir(tPres,ntrs,TR,psdwin,tDelay,PerEvW)
%
% X = fast_sched2Xfir(tPres,ntrs,TR,psdwin,tDelay,PerEvW)
%
% Creates a design matrix (aka stimulus convolution matrix) modeling
% the hemodynamic response as an FIR with adjustable tap weights. The
% matrix is for a single event type whose schedule is passed by tPres.
%
% tPres - list of presentation times (ie, the schedule) in seconds 
% for one event type. Time=tDelay is defined as the time the first 
% stored image was collected (ie, ignore discarded acquisitions). An 
% event before t=0 will have an effect on the matrix if its Post 
% Stimulus Window encompasses t=0; otherwise it is ignored. Events 
% found after the termination of data collection are ignored (a warning 
% is printed). If tPres is empty, a matrix of the correct size
% filled with zeros is returned. 
%
% ntrs - number of functional volumes collected (do not include 
% discarded acquisitions or prescan time).
%
% TR - TR of the exmperiment (ie, time between acquisitions of 
% functional volumes) in seconds.
%
% psdwin - three/four component vector indicating the Post Stimulus
% Delay window. The components are: psdmin dpsd psdmax bcw. dpsd 
% has also been called the TER. bcw is the Box Car Width. If bcw
% is not present, it is assumed to be 0. See fast_psdwin for more 
% details
%
% tDelay - set the definition of t=0. This can be handy for
% taking the slice acquisition delay into account. Ie, creating
% a different X matrix for each slice. In this case, set tDelay
% equal to the time between when the first slice is acquired 
% and the nth slice.
%
% PerEvW - presentation weighting. Length should be NPresentations. The
% matrix entry for each presentation is given the value W(n) instead
% of 1. Ignored if W=[].
%
% X will have size: Ntp by (psdmax+bcw-psdmin-dpsd)/dpsd

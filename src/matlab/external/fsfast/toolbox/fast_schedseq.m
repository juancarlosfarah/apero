function tseq = fast_schedseq(seq, tpercond, TER, TScan, TPreScan)
%
% tseq = fast_schedseq(seq, tpercond, TER, TScan, TPreScan)
%
% Computes a (random) time at which each event in sequence seq 
% can occur. No optimization is performed here.
%
% seq is the sequence of events. Each event is coded 1-N. Zero cannot
% be used as an event code. Event codes should be contiguous from 1-N.
%
% tpercond is the amount of time allocated for each event type. Its
% length must be equal to the number of event types.
%
% TER is the temporal estimation resolution (in seconds).
%
% TScan is the length of the scan (in seconds) during which data
% are collected AND stored (do not include discarded acquisitions).
%
% TPreScan is the amount of time before the onset of scanning that
% stimuli should begin to appear. Where "the onset of scanning" is
% defined as the first image collected AND stored. Note that TPreScan
% is not inherently related to the number discarded acquisitions. 
% TPreScan allows the user to present stimuli before images are
% collected. If this is done, then these presentations should be
% considered during the analysis.
%
% tseq is a list of times at which the items in seq should be presented.
% The times are in seconds relative to the first image that is
% collected AND stored.

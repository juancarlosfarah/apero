% This will remove the runs listed in rmlist from the temporal
% covariance matrix tcvmall. It is assumed that tcvmall was
% created from nruns, each nt = size(tcvmall)/nruns, so that
% tcvmall constsists of nruns X nruns blocks, with each block 
% being nt X nt. If M is a member of rmlist, then this function
% will remove the Mth block row and column from tcvmall.

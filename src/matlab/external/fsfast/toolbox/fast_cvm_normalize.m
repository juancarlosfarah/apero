function [ocvm, acoravg, acorstd] = fast_cvm_normalize(icvm,nmax)
% ocvm = fast_cvm_normalize(icvm,nmax)
%
% Covariance matrix normalization.
%
% icvm - input covariance matrix
% ocvm - normalized covariance matrix
%
% Forces all the diagonals elements of ocvm to be equal. The value of the 
% output diagonal is equal to the mean of the input diagonal divided by
% the mean of the main diagonal (this forces the elements of the main 
% diagonal to be one). If nmax is set, then diagonals beyond nmax are 
% set to 0. Setting the diagonals to be equal enforces the assumption
% that the noise is stationary across observations.  
%
% Each diagonal is set to a constant equal to the mean of that diagonal
% divided by the mean of the main diagonal. This forces the main diagonal
% to be 1.

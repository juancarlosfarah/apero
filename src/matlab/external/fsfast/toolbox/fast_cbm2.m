% [cbm idealcbm] = fast_cbm2(seq,order)
%
% Defines nth order counter balancing as the probability of 
% getting a particular stimulus after a order-length sequence
% of stimuli. If there are N event types in the sequence, then
% the number of possible order-length sequnces is M = N^order
% The counter-balance matrix (CBM) has a size MxN. The entry in 
% the ith row and jth column is the probability of seeing event
% type j after subsequence i.  
%
% Eg. N=3, order=3. M = 27. CBM is MxN:
% i=1 --> (1,1,1)
% i=2 --> (1,1,2)
% i=3 --> (1,1,3)
% i=4 --> (1,2,1)
% i=5 --> (1,2,2)
% ...
%
% All the numbers within a column of the idealcbm are the same 
% and equal the number of times the jth type was presented divided 
% by the total number of presentations. The idealcbm is also MxN.
%
% See also fast_cbm(). Unlike fast_cbm(), the CBM of only the 
% specified order is computed. 
%
% Order must be <= 3.

function RM = fmri_mrestriction2(wcond,wdelay,sumconds,sumdelays)
% RM = fmri_mrestriction2(wcond,wdelay,sumconds,sumdelays)
%
% Creates a restriction matrix given the vector of condition 
% weights and the vector of delays weights.  
%
% Notes:
%  1. wcond is the vector of condition weightings NOT including
%     the null condition.
%  2. The number of rows in  RM will be:
%            1    for sumconds=1 and sumdelays=1
%       nconds    for sumdelays=1
%       ndelays   for sumconds=1
%       nc*nd     for sumconds=0 and sumdelays=0

% 
% Samples spmhrf at the given times.  fast_spmhrf will try
% to do some normalization, which changes the shape/amplitude when
% sampled over different times.  This works by sampling the HRF at a
% very fine resolution (1ms), then finding the values at tsamples in
% the oversampled HRF. The HRF is scaled such that the
% *oversampled* HRF is 1.0. The max of the returned hrf may or may
% not be 1.0 depending upon how close one of the tsamples falls
% to where the max is. 
%
% If nderiv is > 0, then the gradient of the hires HRF is computed
% nderiv times then sampled at tsample. The 1ms sample time is
% factored in when compuding the gradient: hrf0 = gradient(hrf0,dt);
%
% tsamples can be a matrix.

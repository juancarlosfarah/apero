function ipeak = pkpulse(pulse,thresh)
% ipeak = pkpulse(pulse,thresh)
% 
% Returns the indices of the peaks in pulse.  Algorithm: convert pulse 
% into a vector of 0s and 1s by thresholding it at thresh.  If thresh is
% at the right level, this will create boxcar train of 1s and 0s.  This is 
% differentiated so that the begining of the boxcar is 1 and the end is -1.
% The peak is between these two limits is returned for each boxcar.
%
% A plot of just the peaks can be obtained by:
%   pulsepeaks = zeros(size(pulse));
%   pulsepeaks(ipeak) = pulse(ipeak);

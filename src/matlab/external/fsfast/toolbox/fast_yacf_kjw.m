% Remove bias from residual autocorrelation function using Keith
% Worsley's fmristats method. The bias is induced by projecting out
% the task components to form the residual.
%
% racf is the autocor function of the residual. This
%  can be nf X nv. See fast_acorr.m
% R is the residual forming matrix
% yacf is an approximation of the autocor function
%  of the original noise.
% M is the correction matrix.
% p - cant remember. Default is number of frames. I think it's the
%  same as running it like fast_yacf_kjw(racf(1:p,:),R)
%
% Notes:
%  1. As the number of frames increases, the computation is 
%     more intense and the correction matrix is more singular.
%     There is some happy medium where the accuracy of the 
%     ACF is best, but it depends upon the design among other
%     things.
%
% See also: fast_acorr, fast_kjw_mtx.

A Preprocessing Pipeline Builder for Neuroimaging Data
======================================================

Motivation
----------

We all know that preprocessing neuroimaging data is hard and tedious. We created
Apéro to make this process easier and to promote reliable preprocessing pipelines
that can help make research reproducible. This work builds on the preprocessing
pipeline used in `Amico et al., NeuroImage (2017) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.020)>`_.
